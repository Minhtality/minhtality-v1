        <h4>Full Site Migration with CSM Integration</h4>
        <p>After the Model Page re-design pitch, this project kicks off to fully migrate the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexus.com/">lexus.com</a>  from from a legacy codebase of over 700k line of code over to React components.</p>
        <p>I was the sole frontend developer on 1 of the 3 teams that worked on this project. Responsible for some of the notable features such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Migrate the model <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexus.com/models/LC/visualizer">visualizer</a> to React and integrate with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) for content management.</li>
            <li>Migrate the sub-nav component to React, add support for scroll detection, add variations between use case like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexus.com/lcertified">LCertified Pages</a> vs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexus.com/models/IS500">Model Pages</a></li>
            <li>Analytics integration with custom firetags, Flashtalking, and Ensighten.</li>
            <li>Offers data integration with AEM and mocks for Storybook.</li>
            <li>Enables site-wide animation.</li>
        </p>
        </ul>

        <p>
            One of the biggest challenge was the ability to click to drag-and-drop components in AEM that allows content editors to easily update the site and build new ones without having to know any code.</p>

      <h4>A Redesign Pitch of The Lexus Model Page.</h4>
      <p>This project was an overhaul of the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191108081431/https://www.lexus.com/models/LC">legacy model page</a>, originally built in vanilla Javascript and handlebar templates, which consisted of a lot technical debt and duplicated code.</p>
      <p>The goal was to create a more modern and engaging experience for the user, while maintaining the brand's identity, code scalability, improve performance, and accessibility.</p>
      <p>The new page was built using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html">Java</a> for backend, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> for frontend, <a target="_blank" href="https://react-spring.dev/">React-Spring</a> for animation. All CSS 
        were written from scratch and documented in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html">Storybook</a>, allows creatives and stakeholders to view each standalone component style guide.</p>
