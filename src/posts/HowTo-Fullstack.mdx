# How I created a full-stack e-commerce website with Next.js and Strapi

<InfoBlock title="Disclosure:">

    I should note that I have a vested interest in this topic: I teach software development online. It would be bad for my business if developer jobs start disappearing.

    That said, everything in this blog post is based on my true beliefs. You can decide for yourself if those beliefs are biased or not.
